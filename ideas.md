# IDEAS #

Talking point for our idea for the project !

Demarcus: So our idea we landed on was a landing page feature a a title card or selector of personalized design. Here it would be professional designed. or buisness ready. Then then when selected, it would then take you to an option of 2 pages. My page would incorporate playabe music or video and a little about me and my coding goals. I may even link to my other projects. 

Lizzy: We decided on a landing page that showcases both of our biographies. We will start with a homepage with two different logos. When the user clicks on one or the other, it will take them to either one of our pages with a bio and a YT video or song we like. The bio will have a short about us and our goals for our SE career.

Option 2: There would be nummerous images on a page. they would be chests or random thing. when clicked, you would be transitioned to a new page for a suprise!
