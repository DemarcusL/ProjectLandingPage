# IDEAS #

Talking point for our idea for the project !

Demarcus: So our idea we landed on was a landing page feature a a title card or selector of personalized design. Here it would be professional designed. or buisness ready. Then then when selected, it would then take you to an option of 2 pages. My page would incorporate playabe music or video and a little about me and my coding goals. I may even link to my other projects. 

Lizzy: We decided on a landing page that showcases both of our biographies. We will start with a homepage with two different logos. When the user clicks on one or the other, it will take them to either one of our pages with a bio and a YT video or song we like. The bio will have a short about us and our goals for our SE career.

Option 2: There would be nummerous images on a page. they would be chests or random thing. when clicked, you would be transitioned to a new page for a suprise!


Milestones: Completed
-get our image linked to ur personal page first and then work on mouse over events.
-onload, ask for name, store name. 
-welcome message with user name should be displayed


Milestones: TO DO
-hover over for selfie image and appears w/ short bio.
-'click to learn more' button loads at the bottom of bio. (empty page for now).
-look into a mouse over evt instead of on-click, can save code and build cohesiveness.
-Implement scroll feature to navigate the homepage.
-Implement iframe onclick feature
-set up message that will be dispalyed on each homepage. 
-set up iframe for when ball is cliked
