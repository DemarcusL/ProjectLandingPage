            <h1> What do you want to know about me? </h1>
            <p> As I said before my name is Demarcus Lester. I was born on March 21, 1998. I graduated from MAHS High
                School. After studying Communications for 2 years I decided to pursue coding after talking to a friend
                who has been rather successful in his endeavors. Soon after I sought out Code Crew in Memphis, Tn. I
                attended a one day workshop and have been writing this part of my story ever since ! You can refer to my
                <a href="https://github.com/DemarcusL" class="linkM"> GitHub </a> link to see more of my works. I have
                experience in Javascript, HTML 5, and CSS. I aim to be a Full Stack Developer in the near future.
