            <p> As I said before my name is Demarcus Lester. I was born on March 21, 1998. I graduated from MAHS High School. After studying Communications for 2 years I decided to pursue coding after talking to a friend who has been rather successful in his endeavors. Soon after I sought out Code Crew in Memphis, Tn. I attended a one day workshop and have been writing this part of my story ever since ! You can refer to my <a href="https://github.com/DemarcusL" class="linkM" > GitHub </a> link to see more of my works. </p>
